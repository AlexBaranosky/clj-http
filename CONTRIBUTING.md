# Contributing Guidelines

First, thanks for the contributing! Hopefully you find it fairly painless, but
in the interest of explanation, here are some things you might be interested in
when contributing code:

- Please run the tests locally if you submit a change, you can use `lein all
  test :all` to ensure that they pass locally
- If you're able, adding tests with a PR is fantastic! If not, no worries, I can
  add those later
- Don't hesitate to ask if you have questions, use `@dakrone` or you can email
  me (if it's something you can't talk about publically) at `lee [at]
  writequit.org`

That's it, thanks for using and contributing to clj-http!
